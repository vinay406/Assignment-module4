    "Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to True or False. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif (short for else if), and else. Here’s how they work, illustrated with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "if statement\n",
    "The if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "example\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")  # This line will be printed because x > 5 is True\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x > 5 is the condition being checked.\n",
    "Since x is 10, which is indeed greater than 5, the statement inside the if block (print(\"x is greater than 5\")) is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- if else statement:-\n",
    "The else statement follows an if statement and executes a block of code if the if condition is False.\n",
    "Example 2: if-else statement\n",

    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x > 5 is False because x is 2.\n",
    "Therefore, the else block (print(\"x is not greater than 5\")) is executed.\n",
    "3. if ... elif ... else Statement\n",
    "The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It follows an if statement and is followed by an optional else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example 3: if-elif-else statement\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 5\")  # This line will be printed because x > 5 and x == 5 are False\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x > 5 is False because x is 3.\n",
    "x == 5 is also False.\n",
    "Therefore, the else block (print(\"x is less than 5\")) is executed.\n",
    "Nested if Statements\n",
    "You can also nest if statements within one another to create more complex decision-making processes.\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is greater than y but x is odd\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than y\")\n",
    "In this example:\n",

    "The outer if checks if x is greater than y.\n",
    "If x is indeed greater than y, it then checks whether x is even or odd using another if statement nested inside.\n",
